This is another of Brad's courses on going minimal.

No frameworks, no CSS libraries,

It uses the new Grid based CSS which in a way replaces Bootstrap.

== Introduction

Start design with phone first and then scale up to a desktop.

Focus on using Visual Studio Code for IDE.

=== Live Server

Use *Live Server* extension to VSCode for dynamic web page refreshes.

.Live Server Extension

Starting up the Live server

.Starting Live Server

The server opens and load the pages you selected.

.Live Server Loaded

NOTE: The port is typically 5500
 

 
== Emmet 


Emmet extension built into VSCode kbd:[!+Tab] to generate HTML scafolding inside of a HTML file.

Create a `div` tag with a class name of `container` type

 .container kbd[tab]

Create a H1 tag with a class of `brand` type

 h1.brand kbd[tab]

To get a set of 3 list item `li` type

  li*3 kdb[Tab]

  





== HTML responsiveness

The `viewport` meta tag is important for responsive web pages

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">



== Raw Form

The raw form is just the HTML without any styling sheets.

.Raw Form

== CSS

`*{}` - refers to everything on the page.

`box-sizing: border-box;` - Any width will factor in the margin and padding into width

`font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;` - A very nice display font

`list-style: none;` - Elminate the bullets on the list items

== ICONS

The icons come from https://use.fontawesome.com[font awesome].
We will use the CDN and copy the link into the code.

To add an ICON to the page use  `<i class="fa fa-road">`

 
== Finished form

The finished form works with smaller devices first, then resizes for larger ones.  
The reformatting for larger devices is quite a change from the mobile first.

=== Mobile First

.Mobile First

=== Large devices

.Larger devices

== Animate

A little icing on the cake is some animation.

This uses the https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/[Animate.css] style sheet.

We will use the https://cdnjs.com/libraries/animate.css/[CDN version]
